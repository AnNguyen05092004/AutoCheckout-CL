"""Pseudo-labels for objects of earlier tasks: prototypical pseudo-label generation (PPG), fix F6.

At task t (t >= 2) only objects of task-t classes are annotated. The teacher (the model after task
t-1) proposes objects of earlier classes, and PPG keeps

- high-confidence proposals: score > tau_high;
- medium-confidence proposals (tau_low < score <= tau_high) whose query feature is close to the
  prototype of the proposed class (cosine >= sim_thresh).

Differences with the original `local_trainer.generate_old_class_pseudo_labels` (kept for P1):

- candidates are ranked per query, using the query's best earlier class; classes >= PREV (current
  and future tasks, and the unused last slot) are excluded before ranking. The original took the
  top-5 (query, class) pairs over all classes first and filtered afterwards, which leaves too few
  candidates for images with about 12 objects, and one query could yield several labels;
- only labels < PREV are accepted (the original used <=, which let in the first class of the
  current task);
- a candidate's feature is taken at its query index (the original indexed the feature tensor with
  the candidate's position in the top-k list).

Boxes stay in the normalised (cx, cy, w, h) format of the model outputs and of the targets.
